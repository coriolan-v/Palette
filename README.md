# Palette
A capacitive PCB touchwheel for color mixing

Palette is a hand-held color mixing tool. It has 3 capacitive pads for Red, Green, Blue color selection, and 12 capacitive pads for brightness selection. 
You pick a color and scroll around with your thumb, like the old iPod click wheels.
15 individually addressable side-emitting LEDs cast the color on the surface of the PCBs.
The processor is a ESP32 on an Adafruit Feather.

The firwmare will be added a later date
